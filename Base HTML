				<h2>ROCKET LEAGUE</h2>
				<img src="images/rocket.jpg" width="510px" height="340px" alt="rocket league">
            <div class="definition">
					<ul>
						<li>Rocket League is a football game featuring rocket powered cars. It makes use of advanced Artificial Inteligence (AI) techniques (as advanced as the current state of AI)</li>
						<br>
						<li>Although it may look like any other sports game, the game AI is very powerful in order to handle the ball game strategy. This provides a realistic experience for the player (hopefully you!).</li>
						<br>
						<li>The game works through use of <em>bots</em> or "AI-controlled non-player characters" which can assit or oppose the player in question...</li>
						<br>
						<li>A game consisting of just bots and 1 player can be played, or bots can fill in spots of dropped players in online multiplayer versions!</li>
						<br>
						<li>The bots are displayed in the exact same was as an ordinary player would, meaning that it's sometimes hard to distinguish between them and the advanced AI technology used, doesn't help! </li>
						<br>
						<li>Can be played on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC versions!</li>

				<h2>HARRY POTTER: WIZARDS UNITE</h2>
				<img src="images/harry-potter.png" width="510px" height="340px" alt="Harry Potter: Wizards Unite cover photo">
				<div class="definition">
					<ul>
						<li>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite is a Pokémon Go-esque augmented reality game based on the novel series "Harry Potter"</li>
						<br>
						<li>It's a game that's almost entirely based around exploring  the outdoors and meeting up with other players in public spaces. As a result of the current situation, this isn't as easy to do as it was previously.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Fortunately, a solution is being devised a solution. This solution is based on a real place in the book series: the Knight Bus, which will be added to allow players to play from home, but together. </li>
						<br>
						<li>You'll now be able to use the “Knight Bus” button on the map in order to be "teleported" there where you'll be able to interact with other players who have done the same.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Can be played on all mobile devices!</li>

				<h2>JUST DANCE</h2>
				<iframe width="510px" height="340px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlBbPSVrzFg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen alt="Beat Saber Video"></iframe>
				<div class="definition">
					<ul>
						<li>Just Dance is a motion-based dancing game for multiple players, with each game including a collection of classic and modern songs each with their own dance choreographies!</li>
						<br>
						<li>It makes use of motion sensors in order to compare your movement to that of the plaers on screen whom you must mimic in order to earn points which are transactable when visiting the in-game store, "Gift-Machine".</li>
						<br>
						<li>As it requires motion, it turns out to be a great home workout when needed!</li>
						<br>
						<li>Can be played on the Xbox 360!</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<h2>BEAT SABER</h2>
				<iframe width="510px" height="340px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W3ttxPsqrco?list=TLPQMTgxMjIwMjBHYo31egE-Kg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>				
				<div class="definition"> 
					<ul>
						<li>Beat Saber is all about keeping rhythm. In each hand, you hold a lightsaber, one blue and one red.</li>
						<br>
						<li>When the music starts, small blocks with a colored arrow on each begin gliding toward you — much like other rhythm games — and it's up to you to slash the blocks in the direction noted by the arrow.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Similar to "Just Dance", it's a great way of working out while also having fun!</li>
						<br>
						<li>Can be played on PC and Playstation 4 but must be used in combination with a VR headset.</li>
